The system continuously monitors the driver's health while they operate a vehicle. In the event of a sudden cardiac arrest or any other health issue, such as a significant change in heart rate or oxygen levels, the system can help prevent accidents. It does this by immediately sending a live location and alert message to the user's family, the system administrator, and the police. Additionally, if the driver is involved in an accident, the system automatically detects the incident and sends the necessary alerts along with the driver's location.
